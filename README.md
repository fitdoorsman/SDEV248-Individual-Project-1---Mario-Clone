Late For Tipoff
Overview

Late For Tipoff is a 2D platformer built in Godot 4.
You play as a student racing across campus to reach the gym before tipoff. Along the way, you must avoid enemies, collect energy drinks, and manage your limited lives while navigating through the level.

To complete the game, you must collect 10 drinks and then reach the gym doors.

Gameplay
